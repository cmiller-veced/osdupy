# Mundane

but essential



## Version Control

### Github

- Create a github account.
- add an ssh key https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
- create a repo
- commit and push on the command line


### Git

Avoid `merge`.  It's always more trouble than it's worth.  Except when merging
a branch.

Commonly used commands ...

- git status
- git branch
- git commit
- git push
- git checkout

- always work on a branch
- never commit to main/master
- never commit to another's branch without permission
- squash all commits on a branch. https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/git-squash


## Python

### pip

`python -m pip `
`python -m pip install pytest`
